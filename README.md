## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into three main sections:

1. [**Data Analytics**](#1-data-analytics)
2. [**Machine Learning**](#2-machine-learning)
3. [**Cloud Computing**](#3-cloud-computing)

---

## 1. Data Analytics

The **Data Analytics** section features **HydroSuite**, a collection of web-based tools developed by the **Hydroinformatics Lab at the University of Iowa**. These tools enable:

- Development of hydrologic web applications
- Fast in-browser analysis
- Enhancement and extension of existing tools

The objective is to demonstrate the use of web-based systems to improve current hydrological workflows. For complete documentation, [**click here**](/Data%20Analytics/README.md).

## 2. Machine Learning

The **Machine Learning** section provides a series of tutorials focused on **time series processing** for hydrology-related datasets. Topics include:

- Data acquisition from multiple sources
- Data exploration, cleaning, and preparation
- Feeding processed data into machine learning models

It covers a range of models, from **ARIMA** to **Transformers**, with step-by-step guides and detailed explanations.

Explore more [**here**](/Machine%20Learning/README.md).
