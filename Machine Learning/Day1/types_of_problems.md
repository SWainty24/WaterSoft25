## Types of problems ML can solve in hydrology:

### a) Regression Problems:

- Predicting continuous variables like river discharge, groundwater levels, or pollutant concentrations

### b) Classification Problems:

- Categorizing water quality (e.g., safe/unsafe)
- Identifying land use/land cover types affecting water resources
- Detecting anomalies in sensor data

### c) Time Series Analysis:

- Forecasting hydrological variables over time (e.g., streamflow, precipitation)
- Detecting trends and seasonality in water-related data

### d) Clustering:

- Grouping similar hydrological regimes or watersheds
- Identifying regions with similar water quality characteristics

### e) Dimensionality Reduction:

- Simplifying complex hydrological datasets
- Extracting key features from high-dimensional water quality data

### f) Image Recognition:

- Analyzing satellite or drone imagery for water resource assessment
- Identifying land use patterns affecting water systems

### g) Optimization:

- Finding optimal solutions for water allocation
- Optimizing the placement of monitoring stations

### h) Anomaly Detection:

- Identifying unusual patterns in water consumption
- Detecting sensor malfunctions or data quality issues

### i) Pattern Recognition:

- Identifying recurring hydrological patterns
- Recognizing the impact of climate phenomena (e.g., El Ni√±o) on water resources

### j) Natural Language Processing:

- Analyzing water policy documents or research papers
- Extracting relevant information from unstructured water-related text data
